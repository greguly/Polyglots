WordPress Polyglots
==========

**Project Goals**

Create a plugin that gives more context when someone wants to translate WordPress, plugins or themes that can:

1. Shows what the current status is of the locale their installation is in.
2. Notifies users of strings that have yet to be translated into their language.
3. Provides direct links to the GlotPress entries for those strings.
4. When possible be able to do in page translations.
